## 💼 Featured Work — RealDealKickz (Contract)

**Contract Full-Stack Software Engineer**  
*Nov 2025 – Present*

Replaced Shopify with a custom Next.js + Supabase commerce platform designed for reliability, security, and cost control.

**Key Outcomes**

- Reduced infrastructure costs by **58%** by migrating to a custom Next.js architecture using Supabase, Upstash Redis, AWS SES, and Vercel.
- Designed and implemented a layered e-commerce backend spanning **60+ API routes** with transactional order processing and strict repository boundaries.
- Achieved a **100% order success rate** with zero duplicate charges or inconsistent order states through Stripe + Shippo webhook signature verification and idempotent event persistence.
- Maintained **100% deployment uptime** with GitHub Actions CI/CD including migration validation, build verification, and post-deploy health checks.

**Security & Architecture Highlights**

- Built a centralized request proxy pipeline enforcing:
  - CSRF protection  
  - Upstash rate limiting  
  - MFA-based admin guardrails  
  - Security headers and request IDs  

- Secured **100% of authenticated and admin endpoints** with zero unauthorized access incidents.
- Implemented Stripe event idempotency via persistent `stripe_events` tracking.
- Enforced layered architecture: route → service → repository → DB.

Core platform design and operational model are documented across:

- System design and entity model :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Security posture and proxy enforcement :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Operational runbook and incident handling :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Full system overview and stack boundaries :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
